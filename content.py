    - **What do I need to get an A?**: I wrote a grade [calculator](https://practical-davinci-2538f5.netlify.app/) that tells a student exactly what 
    score is needed for each assessment to reach a target grade.  
    - **Got an Edge?**: I wrote a Streamlit app (similar to this resume) that introduces 
    the concept of edge detection in Computer Vision. Feel free
    to check out the [app](https://share.streamlit.io/mmonzoor/edge_detection/app.py) 
    and scroll to the bottom if you want to upload your own image to find edges with!
    - **Avoid the Potholes!**: I wrote a tutorial introducing the steps of fetching, 
    parsing, and cleaning data with the objective of creating meaningful visualizations 
    for exploratory analysis. If you are interested, check out my [repo](
    https://github.com/mmonzoor/introductory_pot_hole_viz) and my [article](

    - **Blockbuster Nostalgia**: I created a Virtual Movie Rental store as a throw back to 
    the ol' days of Blockbuster. The project was written in Java and I used the
    IMDB API to fetch movie records and mimicked the flow of an e-commerce store 
    for movie rentals. Detailed explanation for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/mmonzoor/CIT591_IMDB).
